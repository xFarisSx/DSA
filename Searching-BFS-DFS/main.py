BFS => starts from up, going to the right on every line to search O(n)
 => Shortest Path, Closer Nodes, More memory
DFS => going down then back up, going down again O(n) =>
 Less Memory, Does Path Exist, Can Get Slow
"""
"""
If you know a solution is not far from the root? BFS
If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare? BFS
If the tree is very wide? DFS (BFS=>much memory)
If solutions are frequnet but located deep in the tree? DFS
Determining whether a path exists between 2 nodes? DFS
Finding the shortest path? BFS
